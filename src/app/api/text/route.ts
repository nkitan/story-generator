Eliot, amongst others, described The Dead as one of the greatest short stories ever written.Irish middle-class life jumps from the page, as Gabriel Conroy gives a speech at a family party and finds his principles and beliefs challenged.There is a lyrical, melancholic tone as his thoughts move from awkward social encounters, to Irish nationalism, to the role of the dead in peopleâ€™s lives. It offers a beautifully accessible route into the world of an often-inaccessible writer.")
