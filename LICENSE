StoryGenerator.in License
Version 1, September 2024

Copyright (C) 2024 Ankit Das
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
The StoryGenerator.in License is a free, non-commercial, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

Most licenses are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the StoryGenerator.in License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program, provided that it remains free and is not used commercially.

When we speak of free software, we refer to freedom, not price. The StoryGenerator.in License ensures that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (non-commercially), to receive source code or get it if you want, to change the software or use pieces of it in new free, non-commercial programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying these rights or imposing commercial use restrictions. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others and keep it non-commercial.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Source Code
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of a work.

Basic Permissions
All rights granted under this License are granted provided that the work is not used for commercial purposes. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program for non-commercial purposes only.

Conveying Verbatim Copies
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that:

You publish an appropriate copyright notice.
You make clear that the software is distributed under this License and may not be used for commercial purposes.
Conveying Modified Source Versions
You may convey a work based on the Program under the terms of this License, provided that:

The modified work is clearly marked as modified.
It is released under this License with the non-commercial restriction intact.
Non-Commercial Clause
The work licensed under the StoryGenerator.in License cannot be used, directly or indirectly, for any commercial purpose, including but not limited to charging money for copies or services related to the Program.

Disclaimer of Warranty
There is no warranty for the program. The software is provided "as is" without any guarantee of fitness for a particular purpose.
